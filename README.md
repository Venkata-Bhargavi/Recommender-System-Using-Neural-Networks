# Recommender-System-Using-Neural-Networks


## What is Recommender System, How is it achieved?




## Training Setup:

- Install Dependencies mentioned in notebook
- run `training.ipynb` notebook on Jupyter or Visual Studio
- Set up CUDA for faster trianing, `Tesla 37C`(Single Machine) is used in our setup
- Trained model is saved on `model` folder with .pth extension

`training.ipynb` : Contains code to prepare data and train model
`EDA.ipynb` : Contains Exploratory data analysis on the entire data
`train.csv`, `evaluation.csv` : Contains 80:20 split of the entire dataset
